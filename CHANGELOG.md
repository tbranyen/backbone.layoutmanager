## 0.8.8 ##

* Upgraded Cheerio dependency to v0.11.0.
* Many optimizations and fixes to `getViews` by @jugglinmike.  This includes
  fixes for issues like `removeView` on an invalid selector.
* `cleanup` is now called with the proper context.
* @SBoudrias added `.gitattributes` and `.editconfig` to ease development

  into `$()`.

## 0.8.6 ##

* We now log a warning if you use mutliple top level elements inside a View's
  template with `el: false`.  This will not affect most developers.  If you
  wish to suppress the warnings you can run `Backbone.Layout.configure({
  suppressWarnings: true });`.  This is documented in the Wiki:
  https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/wiki/Configuration#el

  browser parity, and allowing more seamless browser/server View sharing.
* Ability to disable `Backbone.View#el` wrapper element using `el: false` and
  opt for the first child inside the template instead.  Very experimental!
* Added Backbone event bubbling from nested Views to parent.
* The `getView` function can receive a `_.where` object now, to easily filter
  through the Views.
* Updated `getView` to have an `undefined` first argument to be passed allowing
  for an optional selector.
* Changed Grunt configuration from JavaScript to CoffeeScript.

  automatically for you.

  have to override fetch with an `_.identity` function.
* Miscellaneous code cleanup and minor bug/refactor fixes.

* `myView.render().view` now allows you to attach `view.el` after a render for
  some nice one-liners.
   `
