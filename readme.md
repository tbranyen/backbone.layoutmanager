backbone.layoutmanager v0.6.5
=============================

Created by Tim Branyen [@tbranyen](http://twitter.com/tbranyen) with
[contributions](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/contributors)

Provides a logical structure for assembling layouts with Backbone Views.
Designed to be adaptive and configurable for painless integration.

Depends on Underscore, Backbone and jQuery.  You can swap out the dependencies
completely with a custom configuration.

## Download & Include ##

Development is fully commented source, Production is minified and stripped of
all comments except for license/credits.

* [Development](https://raw.github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/master/backbone.layoutmanager.js)
* [Production](https://raw.github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/master/dist/backbone.layoutmanager.min.js)

Include in your application *after* jQuery, Underscore, and Backbone have been
included.

``` html
<script src="/js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/js/underscore.js"></script>
<script src="/js/backbone.js"></script>

<script src="/js/backbone.layoutmanager.js"></script>
```

### Using with Node.js ###

Yep, thats right... LayoutManager is 100% compatible with Node.js projects and
is available as a module in NPM.

To install, simply:

``` javascript
[sudo] npm install backbone.layoutmanager
```

Then you can easily require it into your application.

``` javascript
var Backbone = require("backbone");
var LayoutManager = require("backbone.layoutmanager");
```

Backbone will be augmented with the proper methods exactly like in the browser.

### Using with AMD ###

If you are using RequireJS you can include using the shim configuration.

``` javascript
require.config({
  shim: {
    // Include layoutmanager and ensure Backbone is a loaded dependency.
    "backbone.layoutmanager": ["backbone"]
  }
});
```

If you are using a different AMD loader, perhaps the
[use.js](https://github.com/tbranyen/use.js) plugin will work for you.

## Usage ##

This example renders a View into a template which is injected into a layout.

### Defining the layout and template ###

These example templates are defined using a common pattern which leverages how
browsers ignore `<script></script>` contents when using a custom `type`
attribute.

*Note: This is how LayoutManager expects templates to be defined by default
(using script tags).*

#### Main Layout ####

``` plain
<script id="main-layout" type="layout">
  <section class="content"></section>

  <!-- Login template below will be injected here -->
  <aside class="secondary"></aside>
</script>
```

#### Login Template ####

``` plain
<script id="login-template" type="template">
  <form class="login">
    <p><label for="user">Username</label><input type="text" name="user"></p>
    <p><label for="pass">Password</label><input type="text" name="pass"></p>
    <p><input class="loginBtn" type="submit" value="Login"></p>
  </form>
</script>
```

### Structuring a View ###

Each View can associate a template via the `template` property.  This name by
default is a jQuery selector, but if you have a custom configuration this could
potentially be a filename or JST function name.

*Note: If you do not specify a template LayoutManager will assume the View's
render method knows what it's doing and won't attempt to fetch/render anything
for you.*

``` javascript
var LoginView = Backbone.LayoutView.extend({
  template: "#login-template"
});
```

If you would prefer to use `Backbone.View` as your construct, you can simply
add the `manage: true` assignment to your View:

``` javascript
var LoginView = Backbone.View.extend({
  manage: true
});
```

Alternatively, you can globally configure this (Recommended):

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  manage: true
});
```

*Note: The `manage` property has been designed to make it possible to mix
between LayoutManager specific and non-specific Views.*

### Create and render a layout ###

Each Layout can associate a template via the `template` property.  This
name by default is a jQuery selector, but if you have a custom configuration
this could potentially be a filename or JST function name.

This code typically resides in a route callback.

``` javascript
var main = new Backbone.Layout({
  template: "#main-layout",

  // In the secondary column, put a new Login View.
  views: {
    ".secondary": new LoginView()
  }
});

// Attach the Layout to the <body></body>.
$("body").empty().append(main.el);

// Render the Layout.
main.render();
```

### Adding a layout to the DOM ###

To add a layout into the page, simply inject it into a container at the time of
creation.  Do **not** call `empty().append()` more than once for a layout
element, unless you detach it first.  This is not recommended as it may cause a
flicker during re-rendering.  It's cleaner and more efficient to only create a
layout when you need it and insert into the DOM at that time.

``` javascript
// Create the Layout.
var main = new Backbone.Layout(...);

// Attach Layout to the DOM.
$(".some-selector").empty().append(main.el);

// Optional: (Not recommeded) Detach first if you cache the layout
// main.$el.detach();

// Render the Layout.
main.render();
```

Views may also be alternatively declared outside the Layout initialization:

#### Using the setView function ####

Use the following function to change out views at a later time.  Remember to
call the View's `render` method after swapping out to have it displayed.  The
`setView` return value is the view, so chaining a `render` is super simple.

``` javascript
main.setView(".header", new HeaderView());
main.setView(".footer", new FooterView());

// Chain a render method
main.setView(".header", new HeaderView2()).render();
```

*Note: `setView` and `setViews` methods are available on all views.  This
allows for nested Views, explained below.*

*Note: The first argument *selector* can be omitted completely if you would
like the nested View to exist directly on the element.  This works well when
your parent View is something like a `UL` and your nested View is an `LI`.*

*Note: The third argument is optional, but when set to `true` it will
automatically append the View into the container instead of replacing the
content.*

#### Using the setViews function ####

This is identical to how views are being assigned in the Layout example.  It
can be used in the following way:


``` javascript
var main = new Backbone.Layout({
  template: "#some-layout"
});

// Set the views outside of the layout
main.setViews({
  ".partial": new PartialView()
});
```

### Nested Views ###

You may have a situation where a View is defined that encapsulates other nested
Views.  In these cases you should use nested views inside your LayoutManager
View assignments.

Check out this example to see how easy this is:

``` javascript
var main = new Backbone.Layout({
  template: "#some-layout",

  views: {
    ".partial": new PartialView({
      views: {
        ".inner": new InnerView()
      }
    })
  }
});
```

*Note: You can nest Views infinitely.*

#### Re-rendering Views ####

Instead of re-rendering the entire layout after data in a single View changes,
you can simply call `render()` on the View and it will automatically update
the DOM.

*This syntax is completely valid*

``` javascript
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.model.on("change", this.render, this);
  }
});
```

*As well as this syntax*

``` javascript
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.model.on("change", function() {
      this.render();
    }, this);
  }
});
```

*Note: Do not forget to add event cleanup code whenever you bind events inside
your Views.  There are examples of cleanup below.*

### Rendering repeating views ###

There are many times in which you will end up with a list of nested views
that result from either iterating a `Backbone.Collection` or `Array`
and will need to dynamically add these nested views into a main view.

LayoutManager solves this by exposing a method to change the insert mode
from replacing the `innerHTML` to `appendChild` instead.  Whenever you
use the `insertView` method you will put the nested view into this special
mode.

Sub views are always inserted in order, regardless if the `fetch` method has
been overwritten to be asynchronous.

An example will illustrate the pattern easier:

#### Item Template ####

This item template doesn't need to do much since it will be automatically
wrapped in an `<li></li>` by the View. 

``` plain
<script id="#item" type="template">
  <%= name %>
</script>
```

#### Item View ####

``` javascript
// You may find it easier to have Backbone render the LI/TD/etc element
// instead of including this in your template.  This is purely convention
// use what works for you.
var ItemView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: "#item",

  // In this case we'll say the item is an <LI>
  tagName: "li"
});
```

#### List View ####

The list View simply needs to provide an outlet for the above `<li>` to be
appended into.

``` javascript
// You will need to override the `render` function with custom functionality.  
var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: "ul"

  // Insert all subViews prior to rendering the View.
  beforeRender: function() {
    // Iterate over the passed collection and create a view for each item.
    this.collection.each(function(model) {
      // Pass the sample data to the new SomeItem View.
      this.insertView(new ItemView({
        serialize: { name: "Just testing!" }
      }));
    }, this);
  }
});
```

### How does this not duplicate Views? ###

Internally LayoutManager will remove all View's marked as in *append* mode.
This is any View contained in an array via `setView` or `insertView`.  This
allows View's like ListView above to work without duplicating list items.

If you wanted to keep a View from being removed pre-render, for instance,
keeping a history of items in the DOM or you're just adding new stuff every
render you will need to flag the View to be retained.

``` javascript
var ItemView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: "#item",

  // In this case we'll say the item is an <LI>
  tagName: "li",

  // This will keep the View from being automatically removed by LayoutManager.
  keep: true
});
```

### insertView function ###

The `insertView` function as seen above is simply a shortcut to the `setView`
function, but automatically adds `true` to the append argument.

If you decide to add the selector partial to `insertView`, LayoutManager
will insert into the specified element.

For instance if you had a `<UL>` in your View and you wanted to insert into
that:

``` javascript
var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({
  beforeRender: function() {
    // Append a new ItemView into the nested <UL>
    this.insertView("ul", new ItemView());
  }
});
```

If your View *is* a `<UL>` then you can simply do the following:

``` javascript
var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // Ensure this View is a UL and not a DIV
  tagName: "ul",

  beforeRender: function() {
    // Append a new ItemView to the View.el
    this.insertView(new ItemView());
  }
});
```

If you wish to change `append` to `prepend` you can easily change how the
View is inserted by setting a new `append` function.

``` javascript
var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({
  beforeRender: function() {
    // Append a new ItemView into the nested <UL>.
    this.insertView("ul", new ItemView({
      // Prepend the element instead of append.
      append: function(root, child) {
        $(root).prepend(child);
      }
    }));
  }
});
```

*Note `insertView` can be used outside of `beforeRender` and is especially
useful for when you have an `add` event fire on a Collection.*

#### insertViews function ####

The `insertViews` function is identical to `insertView` except that you can
bulk append like with `setViews`.  You can one or more items by using an array.

``` javascript
var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({
  beforeRender: function() {
    // Append a new ItemView into the nested <UL>.
    this.insertViews({
      // Append a single item.
      "div": new ItemView(),

      // Append multiple items.
      "ul": [new ItemView(), new ItemView()]
    });
  }
});
```
### getView function ###

The `getView` function allows you to find a specific View by some filter
function.

``` javascript
// Find an remove a View if it has the exact Model.
main.getView(function(view) {
  return view.model === someModel;
}).remove();
```

#### getViews function ####

This function works very similar to the `getView` function, except that it will
always return a wrapped (Underscore/Lo-Dash) collection of matching View's.  If
you omit the filter function, it will return all subViews flattened and wrapped
in the same way.

``` javascript
// Find all sub views flattened in a wrapped Collection.
main.getViews()

// Find all sub views that have a model.
main.getViews(function(view) {
  return view.model;
});
```

### Working with template data ###

Template engines bind data to a template.  The term context refers to the
data object passed.

LayoutManager will look for a `serialize` method or object automatically:

``` javascript
var LoginView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: "#login-template",

  // Provide data to the template
  serialize: function() {
    return this.model.toJSON();
  }
});
```

## Advanced View Concepts ##

Once you've mastered the above features, you will want to learn more about how
these methods actually work and how to integrate 3rd party plugins like jQuery
into your Views.

### Render function ###

*Breaking change from 0.5.3*: The traditional `render` function is now
completely managed by LayoutManager.  If you attempt to override this on any
View, it will be the `render(template, context)` function, which can be used to
swap the template engine on a specific View. This is **not* the function you
would use to add new Views or set up jQuery plugins.

Every `render` function accepts an optional callback function that will return
the View element once it has rendered itself and all of its children.  The
`render` function returns a `promise` object that can be chained off of as
well.

``` javascript
// Using the callback method
new MyView().render(function(el) {
  // Use the DOMNode el here
});

// Using the promise resolve method
new MyView().render().then(function(el) {
  // Use the DOMNode el here
});
```

### BeforeRender function ###

You now use the `beforeRender` function to add new subViews / run code before
the View has rendered.

``` javascript
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  beforeRender: function() {
    /* Work with the View before render. */
  }
});
```

### AfterRender function ###

You now use the `afterRender` function to attach jQuery plugins / run code
after the View has rendered.

``` javascript
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  afterRender: function() {
    /* Work with the View after render. */
  }
});
```

### Cleanup function ###

Every `Backbone.View` managed by LayoutManager can provide a custom `cleanup`
function that will run whenever the View is overwritten or removed.

``` javascript
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // This is a custom cleanup method that will remove the model events owned by
  // this View.
  cleanup: function() {
    this.model.off(null, null, this);
  },

  initialize: function() {
    this.model.on("change", this.render, this);
  }
});
```

*Note: Be careful with unbinding, you don't want to inadvertently remove events
from this model in other parts of your code.  These are shared objects.*

### Using jQuery Plugins ###

Attaching jQuery plugins should happen inside the `render` or `afterRender`
methods.  You can attach at either the Layout render or the View render.  To
attach in the layout render:

``` javascript
$(".container").empty().append(main.el);

main.render(function() {
  // Elements are guarenteed to be in the DOM
  this.$(".some-element").somePlugin();
});
```

To attach in the View render, you will need to override the `afterRender`
method like so:

``` javascript
afterRender: function() {
  this.$(".some-element").somePlugin();
}
```

## Configuration ##

Overriding LayoutManager options has been designed to work just like
`Backbone.sync`.  You can override at a global level using
`LayoutManager.configure` or you can specify when instantiating a
`LayoutManager` instance.

### Global level ###

Lets say you wanted to use `Handlebars` for templating in all your Views.

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  // Override render to use Handlebars
  render: function(template, context) {
    return Handlebars.compile(template)(context);
  }
});
```

### Instance level ###

In this specific layout, define custom prefixed paths for template paths.

``` javascript
var main = new Backbone.Layout({
  template: "#main",

  // Custom paths for this layout
  paths: {
    template: "/assets/templates/"
  }
});
```

### Defaults ###

* __Paths__:
An empty object.  Two valid property names: `template` and `layout`.

``` javascript
paths: {}
```

* __Deferred__:
Uses jQuery deferreds for internal operation, this may be overridden to use
a different Promises/A compliant deferred.

``` javascript
deferred: function() {
  return $.Deferred();
}
```

* __Fetch__:
Uses jQuery to find a selector and returns its `innerHTML` content as a string
or template function (either works).

``` javascript
fetch: function(path) {
  return _.template($(path).html());
}
```

* __Partial__: 
Uses jQuery to find the View's location and inserts the rendered
element there.  The append property determines if the View should
append, defaults to replace via innerHTML.

``` javascript
partial: function(root, name, el, append) {
  // If no selector is specified, assume the parent should be added to.
  var $root = name ? $(root).find(name) : $(root);

  // If no root found, return false
  if (!$root.length) {
    return false;
  }

  // Use the append method if append argument is true.
  this[append ? "append" : "html"]($root, el);

  // If successfully added, return true
  return true;
}
```

* __HTML__:
Override this with a custom HTML method, passed a root element and an
element to replace the innerHTML with.

``` javascript
html: function(root, el) {
  $(root).html(el);
}
```

* __Append__:
Very similar to HTML except this one will appendChild.

``` javascript
append: function(root, el) {
  $(root).append(el);
}
```

* __Detach__:
Remove an element from the DOM, but maintain events.

``` javascript
detach: function(el) {
  $(el).detach();
}
```

* __When__:
This function will trigger callbacks based on the success/failure of one or
more deferred objects.

``` javascript
when: function(promises) {
  return $.when.apply(null, promises);
}
```

* __Render__:
Renders a template with the `Function` or `String` provided as the template
variable.

``` javascript
render: function(template, context) {
  return template(context);
}
```

### Asynchronous & Synchronous fetching ###

The `fetch` method is overridden to get the contents of layouts and templates.
If you can instantly get the contents (DOM/JST) you can return the
contents inside the function.

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  fetch: function(name) {
    return $("script#" + name).html();
  }
});
```

If you need to fetch the contents asynchronously, you will need to put the
method into "asynchronous mode".  To do this, assign `this.async()`
to a variable and call that variable with the contents when you are done.

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  fetch: function(name) {
    var done = this.async();

    $.get(name, function(contents) {
      done(contents);
    });
  }
});
```

## Sample Configurations ##

You may need to combine a mix of **Engines** and **Transports** to integrate.

### Engines (Mustache, Handlebars, etc.) ###

Custom templating engines can be used by overriding `render`.

#### Underscore ####

``` plain
No configuration necessary for this engine.
```

#### Mustache ####

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  render: function(template, context) {
    return Mustache.to_html(template, context);
  }
});
```

#### Handlebars ####

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  fetch: function (path){
    return Handlebars.compile($(path).html());
  },
  render: function(template, context) {
    return template(context);
  }
});
```

### Transports (DOM, AJAX, etc.) ###

You can swap out how templates are loaded by overriding `fetch`.

#### DOM ####

``` plain
No configuration necessary for this transport.
```

#### AJAX ####

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  fetch: function(path) {
    var done = this.async();

    $.get(path, function(contents) {
      done(contents);
    });
  }
});
```

### Using an Engine and Transport Override for JST ###

Whatever you decide to return as a template in `fetch`, can be used in the
`render` method.

``` javascript
Backbone.LayoutManager.configure({
  fetch: function(name) {
    return window.JST[name];
  },

  render: function(template, context) {
    return template(context);
  }
});
```
